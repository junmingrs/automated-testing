# Automated Testing Tools Group Practical

> A two-hour, hands-on introduction to browser automation using Windows and Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.

> [!NOTE]
> ## Update for students already working on the practical
>
> Continue in your existing repository, branch and virtual environment. Do not clone again, recreate `.venv` or redo completed tests.
>
> From the first browser test onwards, the revised execution commands request an automatic screenshot, an XML test-result file and an HTML report. Existing tests and package requirements are unchanged. Section 13 remains the final full-file submission run, not the first opportunity to generate a report.
>
> Working browser variables may still be used. If `%TEST_BROWSER%` prints literally, use `chrome` or `msedge` directly. Command Prompt is the main teaching shell; Section 6.2 includes a Git Bash activation fallback.

> [!NOTE]
> ## Educational Practice Materials
>
> Use fictional task names only. Do not enter or share personal passwords, API keys, identification numbers, personal contact details or confidential information. Screenshots and traces may contain page content.

Learn automated testing by opening practice websites, automating browser actions and checking results.

No previous automated testing experience is needed. You have already completed a basic Python module. This practical builds on that knowledge. Complete Python examples and explanations are provided. You do not need to build a website, learn JavaScript or create an application server.

Work in a group of 3–5. Each member uses their own computer and GitHub account, creates a separate test file and runs their own tests. Work together when solving problems, but do not divide the guided tests among members. The coordinator prepares only the shared repository and starting files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Team coordination: two additional tests per member
>
> Each member creates and runs two additional tests beyond the eight guided cases. The two tests should check different behaviours or conditions.
>
> Agree scenarios before coding and record them in `docs/test-plan.md`. Prefer scenarios that do not duplicate another member's additional tests.
>
> If there is genuinely no suitable alternative and a scenario must be repeated, agree this within the group and record the reason. Each member writes their own implementation: code must not be copied or identical.
>
> Changing only variable names, function names, comments or task wording does not make copied code different. Use meaningful differences in setup, action sequence, input conditions or assertions while checking the intended behaviour.
>
> Each member captures their own final-result PNG for each additional test. A necessary repeated scenario still needs independent code and independent screenshots.
>
> These rules apply to the additional tests. Supplied guided code may be the same for everyone.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ## Save and share your own test outputs
>
> Commit and push your source, browser recording, HTML report, generated test results and selected PNG evidence. Use member-specific folders under `reports/`, `recordings/`, `test-results/` and `docs/evidence/`.
>
> Do not overwrite or claim another member's outputs. Inspect recordings, reports, images and traces for private information before sharing. Use demonstration data only.
>
> Keep `.venv/`, Python caches, pytest caches and `.env` out of Git. Do not ignore `reports/`, `recordings/` or `test-results/`.

### Where to store your files

Each member stores source, recordings, reports, test results and PNG evidence in the locations below. The example uses Member 1. Replace the member number with your own.

```text

├── __pycache__/              ← Local only: do not commit
└── .pytest_cache/            ← Local only: do not commit
```

Add Member 4 and Member 5 files and folders if needed. Your repository name may differ. Evidence filenames are examples: use names describing your own scenarios.

### What goes where

| Location | What to store | Commit and push? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `tests/test_member_1.py` | Your eight guided cases and two additional tests. | Yes |
| `recordings/member-1/` | Your Python code generated by Codegen. | Yes |
| `reports/member-1/` | Your HTML report and saved XML results. | Yes |
| `test-results/member-1/` | Your generated screenshots, traces and test outputs. | Yes |
| `docs/evidence/member-1/` | Selected final-result PNGs for the two additional tests. | Yes |
| `docs/test-plan.md` | Agreed scenarios and any unavoidable repeats. | Yes |
| `reports/group/` and `test-results/group-run/` | Outputs from the nominated group runner. | Yes, if retained |
| `.venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `.pytest_cache/` | Local environment and temporary files. | No |
| `.env`, if present | Private local settings. | No |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is the intended structure as you complete the practical. Do not create every file now.
>
> The coordinator creates shared starting files. Each member creates their own folders when instructed. Tools generate reports, screenshots and test subfolders when the relevant commands run.
>
> `failure-run/` is used during optional failure investigation. Traces appear only when enabled and the retention conditions are met.
>
> Keep generated runs inside your own member folder. Do not use another member's folder or top-level `test-results/` as your working output directory.


### Practical overview

| Before you start | Use the checklist in Section 1 to confirm your existing software, accounts and access. |
| Operating system | Windows. |
| Python knowledge | Basic Python, from the module completed earlier. |
| Main browser | Installed stable Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge. |
| Terminal | Windows Command Prompt inside VS Code. |
| Project location | A folder of your choice where you can save files. |
| Task-list website | [Playwright TodoMVC](https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/) |

| Cases per member | Eight guided cases plus two individual additional cases: ten before optional additions. |
| Shared outputs per member | Source, recording, HTML report, generated results and two selected PNG evidence files. |
| After the lesson | Optional activities in Section 16. |

### Tools used

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Python | Runs test code. |
| VS Code and its Microsoft Python extension | Help you create and edit files. |
| Chrome or Edge | Runs the browser activities. Choose either one. |
| Playwright | Controls the browser and checks page behaviour. |
| Codegen | Records browser actions and creates starting code. |
| pytest | Finds and runs tests. |
| pytest-html | Creates an HTML results report. |
| Git and GitHub | Save, share and combine changes. |
| Trace Viewer, used after the lesson | Helps you look back through a test run. |

### Browser choices

| Browser | Use | Selection |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Microsoft Edge | Main option. | `--browser chromium --browser-channel msedge` |
| Google Chrome | Equally suitable main option. | `--browser chromium --browser-channel chrome` |
| Playwright Chromium | Optional post-lesson browser. | `--browser chromium` without a channel |
| Playwright Firefox | Optional post-lesson browser. | `--browser firefox` |
| Playwright WebKit | Optional post-lesson browser. | `--browser webkit` |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Chrome and Edge are Chromium-based browsers. In pytest, `--browser chromium` selects the browser family. The channel selects installed Chrome or Edge.
>
> Do not use `--browser chrome` or `--browser edge`. Use `--browser-channel chrome` or `--browser-channel msedge`.
>
> You do not need to download Playwright Chromium for the main lesson.


### Connections to the lesson slides

***

## 1. Before you start: check what you have

You should already have the software and accounts used in this practical. Use this checklist to confirm that you are ready.

### 1.1 Computer and software

- [ ] I am using a Windows computer.
- [ ] I have Python 3.12 or 3.13.
- [ ] I have Visual Studio Code.
- [ ] I have the Python extension published by Microsoft in VS Code.
- [ ] I have Git.
- [ ] I have stable Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge.
- [ ] I have a folder of my choice where I can save the project.

You do not need both Chrome and Edge. Choose either one for the main activities.

### 1.2 Terminal and version checks

Use Command Prompt inside VS Code throughout this practical.

To open it:

1. Select Terminal → New Terminal.
2. Open the dropdown beside the terminal's `+` button.
3. Select Command Prompt to open a new terminal.
4. Use the new terminal, not an existing PowerShell or Git Bash terminal.

If needed, press Ctrl+Shift+P, select `Terminal: Select Default Profile`, choose Command Prompt, then create a new terminal. A Windows computer can run different shells: `PS` indicates PowerShell; a `$` prompt with `bash` errors indicates Bash. The remaining guide uses Command Prompt syntax unless explicitly labelled otherwise.

Run these commands one at a time:

```bat
python --version
```

```bat
git --version
```

You should see a version number for each tool. If the Python command does not work, try:

```bat
py -3 --version
```

- [ ] Command Prompt is open in VS Code.
- [ ] Python displays a version number.
- [ ] Git displays a version number.

> [!TIP]
> If the terminal shows Python's `>>>` prompt, enter `exit()` and press Enter before running terminal commands.

### 1.3 Browser and website access

Open your chosen browser and check that both practice websites load:

- [ ] [Playwright TodoMVC task list](https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/)
- [ ] [The Internet login demonstration](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login)

You do not need to sign in to a personal browser profile or create an account on either practice website.

### 1.4 GitHub and commit identity

- [ ] I have my own GitHub account.
- [ ] I can sign in to GitHub.
- [ ] I know my GitHub username.

Check the name and email Git will use for your commits:

```bat
git config --global user.name
```

```bat
git config --global user.email
```

- [ ] Git displays my intended commit name.
- [ ] Git displays my intended commit email.

If either value is missing or incorrect, replace the example values below with your own details:

```bat
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "YOUR_GITHUB_COMMIT_EMAIL"
```

Use an email linked to GitHub or your GitHub no-reply email.

> [!NOTE]
> Your commit name and email identify your changes. They do not sign you in to GitHub.
>
> Never put passwords or access tokens in project files.

### 1.5 Group details

Confirm these details with your group:

- [ ] We know who will coordinate the initial repository setup.
- [ ] We have agreed on a repository name.
- [ ] Each member has a member number, starting at 1.
- [ ] We have shared our GitHub usernames with the coordinator.
- [ ] Each member knows which personal test filename and branch to use.

Each member will create and run their own tests. The coordinator creates only the shared repository and starting files.

### If something is missing

Check the relevant troubleshooting instructions in Section 17. If software access requires administrator permission, use the approved IT support process. Do not bypass computer or browser restrictions.

The project-specific Python environment and testing packages will be set up together in Section 6.

***

## 2. The two-hour lesson plan

| Time | Activity | Sections |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0–15 minutes | Create/clone the repository; agree scenarios and share setup. | 3–5 |
| 15–25 minutes | Prepare branches, packages, browser and member folders. | 6 |
| 25–35 minutes | Explore and run the first test. | 7 |
| 35–40 minutes | Add completion checking. | 8 |
| 40–50 minutes | Test blank inputs. | 9 |
| 50–65 minutes | Test correct and incorrect login details. | 10 |
| 65–75 minutes | Record, add a check and replay. | 11 |
| 75–80 minutes | Use the helper to add two tasks. | 12.1–12.3 |
| 80–100 minutes | Create two individual tests and selected PNG captures. | 12.4 |
| 100–110 minutes | Generate and inspect reports, recordings, results and PNGs. | 13 |
| 110–120 minutes | Commit own source and outputs; combine and update main. | 14 |
| Total | 120 minutes | |

The timing assumes the software, accounts and website access in Section 1 are already available. If a check reveals a problem, use Section 17 and preserve your progress. Continue unfinished main activities afterwards if necessary. Do not hide errors or remove checks to keep to the timing.

Use Section 15 as a syntax reference, Section 17 when an error appears and Section 18 for common commands. Section 16 provides further practice after the lesson.

***

## 3. Understand the workflow

Playwright performs browser actions. pytest runs test functions. Assertions check the result.

```text
Open a page → Perform an action → Check the result
```

### Key terms

| Term | Simple meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Locator | An instruction that finds part of a page. |
| Action | Something the browser does, such as typing or clicking. |
| Assertion | A check of an expected result. |
| Negative test | A test of invalid input or an invalid action. |
| Parametrization | Running one test with different inputs. |
| Helper | A function that performs steps you want to reuse. |
| Virtual environment | A separate set of Python packages for this project. |
| Browser channel | Installed Chrome or Edge selected for a run. |
| Repository | A project whose changes are tracked by Git. |
| Branch | A separate line of work in a repository. |
| Commit | A saved record of selected changes on your computer. |
| Push | Upload commits to GitHub. |
| Pull request, or PR | A request to combine a branch with another branch. |
| Merge | Combine changes from branches. |
| `.gitignore` | Lists local files and folders to leave out when adding new files to Git. |

Actions:

```python
task_input.fill("Read testing notes")
task_input.press("Enter")
```

Assertion:

```python
expect(task_labels).to_have_text(["Read testing notes"])
```

These snippets explain the idea. Complete examples follow later. A script that only clicks and types may finish without checking the intended result.

A negative test can pass. The incorrect-password test passes when the website rejects the password as expected.


### Where these tests fit

Tests help find problems before users depend on software. A failure may come from application behaviour, test code, environment or an unavailable site. Passing selected checks does not prove all defects are absent.

| Concept | Meaning here |
| --- | --- |
| System-level functional checking | Use a running website through its external interface. |
| Black-box approach | Choose inputs and check outputs without reading application source. |
| Web GUI | Interact with fields, buttons, links and task rows. |
| Automated execution | Tools perform predefined steps after you start pytest. |

These checks sit near the top of the testing pyramid. They do not replace unit or integration tests. Using pytest does not make a browser check a unit test. The `add_task()` helper supports the test; it is not an isolated function from the demonstration application.

This guide does not measure code coverage, perform security or load tests, verify internal service integrations or provide acceptance sign-off. Login checks verify visible behaviour, not security. Test durations are not performance benchmarks.

### Built-in and external tools complement one another

| Tool | Source and purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Browser Developer Tools | Included with Chrome or Edge; inspect elements, messages and requests. |
| Python `unittest` | Included with Python; supports local unit tests. |
| Playwright, Codegen and Trace Viewer | Additional browser-automation and investigation tools. |
| pytest and pytest-html | Additional Python packages for execution and reports. |
| Git and GitHub | Version-control tools and service for sharing source and outputs. |

Choose tools for the goal. Editor integration does not make an external package part of Python's standard library.

### Positive or negative is different from pass or fail

Normal task text and correct login are positive examples. Blank text and an incorrect password are negative examples. Both pass when expected behaviour occurs. In pytest, `FAILED` means a step or assertion did not succeed; it does not mean every negative case should report a failure.

### Shared work pattern

```text
Update main → Create a branch → Edit and run
            → Save → Commit → Push → Open a PR → Merge
            → Everyone updates main
```

Saving does not commit. Committing does not upload. Pushing does not merge.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Enter commands in the terminal and Python code in the named `.py` file. Save before running. Copy only code inside a code block, not surrounding backticks.

> [!WARNING]
> Use only small practice runs. Do not run load tests, security scans or continuous loops against public websites. Do not force-push or use destructive Git commands to bypass a problem.

***

## 4. Create and clone the group repository

### 4.1 Use your member number

| Member | Personal file | Personal branch |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `tests/test_member_1.py` | `testing/member-1` |
| 2 | `tests/test_member_2.py` | `testing/member-2` |
| 3 | `tests/test_member_3.py` | `testing/member-3` |
| 4, if present | `tests/test_member_4.py` | `testing/member-4` |
| 5, if present | `tests/test_member_5.py` | `testing/member-5` |

Examples use Member 1. Replace member numbers in filenames, paths and branches with your own. Keep Python function names unchanged.

### 4.2 Coordinator: create the repository

On GitHub:

1. Create a repository, for example `automated-testing-group-01`.
2. Use approved visibility. A private repository limits access to invited people.
3. Add a README and confirm the starting branch is `main`.
4. Put this guide in `README.md`.
5. Open Settings → Collaborators, or the equivalent access page.
6. Invite members using their GitHub usernames.
7. Members accept their invitations.

### 4.3 Everyone: clone the repository

Choose where to keep the project.

1. In Windows File Explorer, open a folder of your choice where you can save files.
2. Click the address bar and copy its full path.
3. Replace the placeholder below with that path. Keep the quotation marks.

```bat
cd /d "PASTE_YOUR_CHOSEN_FOLDER_PATH_HERE"
```

On GitHub, select Code → HTTPS and copy the repository URL. Replace the placeholder:

```bat
git clone PASTE_THE_COPIED_HTTPS_URL_HERE
```

Enter the new folder using its actual name, for example:

```bat
cd automated-testing-group-01
```

In VS Code, use File → Open Folder to open that project folder. Open a new Command Prompt terminal.

```bat
git status
git remote -v
```

You should be on `main`. `origin`, Git's short name for the remote repository, should point to your group repository.

> [!TIP]
> Members may choose different locations. Run remaining commands inside the cloned project folder, not its parent folder.

### 4.4 Agree additional scenarios

Look ahead at Section 12.4 and reserve two scenarios per member. Prefer different choices across the group; each member's two choices should still differ. If repetition is genuinely unavoidable, record the reason and meaningful implementation differences. Everyone writes their own code and captures their own PNGs. The coordinator records choices in Section 5.5's plan.

***

## 5. Create the shared starting files

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The coordinator completes this section first. Others continue with Section 6 after the setup changes are merged.

### 5.1 Create a setup branch

```bat
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git switch -c setup/testing-files
```

`switch -c` creates a branch. `pull --ff-only` updates only when Git can move the branch directly forward.

### 5.2 Create `.gitignore`

Create `.gitignore` beside `README.md`, not `.gitignore.txt`:

```gitignore
.venv/
__pycache__/
.pytest_cache/
.env
```

| Entry | What stays local |
| --- | --- |
| `.venv/` | Python environment and installed packages. |
| `__pycache__/` | Temporary Python files. |
| `.pytest_cache/` | pytest cache and safe fallback browser output. |
| `.env` | Possible private local settings; not required here. |

Do not ignore `reports/`, `recordings/`, `test-results/` or `docs/evidence/`. Each member shares their own outputs from these folders.

Commit `.gitignore` itself. If earlier rules ignore output folders, the coordinator removes those entries and shares the correction through a PR before members add outputs.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `.gitignore` is not a security tool. It does not remove already tracked files or erase earlier history. Inspect selected changes before committing.

### 5.3 Create `requirements.txt`

```text
pytest-playwright
pytest-html
```

### 5.4 Create `pytest.ini`

```ini
[pytest]
testpaths = tests
addopts = -v --browser chromium --output .pytest_cache/browser-output
```

Keep `--browser chromium`. Members choose Chrome or Edge through commands.

The fallback `--output .pytest_cache/browser-output` keeps a plain run from using top-level `test-results/` as its working output directory. It is ignored. The practical's commands override it with member-specific locations for results you share.

A run can clear its chosen output directory. Never use top-level `test-results/` or another member's folder as `--output`.


### 5.5 Create the shared scenario plan

Create `docs/test-plan.md`. The coordinator records agreed choices:

```markdown
# Group test choices

Each member creates two additional tests and captures their own PNG for each.
Prefer different scenarios. Record unavoidable repeats and meaningful code differences.
Cosmetic changes to copied code are not sufficient.

| Member | First scenario | Second scenario | Evidence folder |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | | | `docs/evidence/member-1/` |
| 2 | | | `docs/evidence/member-2/` |
| 3 | | | `docs/evidence/member-3/` |
| 4, if present | | | `docs/evidence/member-4/` |
| 5, if present | | | `docs/evidence/member-5/` |

## Unavoidable repeats, if any

| Scenario | Members | Why no suitable alternative is available | Meaningful implementation differences |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
```

Remove unused rows. Leave the repeat table empty if unnecessary. Nominate one person to update this shared file if choices change later.

### 5.6 Commit, push and merge

Save the files:

```bat
git add .gitignore requirements.txt pytest.ini docs/test-plan.md
git diff --staged
git commit -m "Add testing configuration and ignore rules"
git push -u origin setup/testing-files
```

`git add` selects changes. `git diff --staged` displays them. `-u` links the local branch to its GitHub branch.

On GitHub, open a PR with base `main` and compare `setup/testing-files`. Inspect Files changed, confirm only intended files appear, then merge.

The base is the destination. The compare branch contains proposed changes.

***

## 6. Prepare your branch and Python environment

### 6.1 Update and create your branch

Use your member number:

```bat
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git switch -c testing/member-1
git status
```

### 6.2 Create and activate the environment

```bat
python -m venv .venv
```

If only the Windows launcher works, use `py -3 -m venv .venv` instead.

```bat
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
```

The path should contain this project's `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are already using Git Bash with an existing Windows Python environment, activate it with `source .venv/Scripts/activate`, not the `.bat` command. Do not copy the `$` prompt symbol. Use a literal browser channel (`chrome` or `msedge`) instead of `%TEST_BROWSER%` in the execution commands. For consistency with this guide, opening Command Prompt is preferred.
>
> If activation is uncertain, run the existing environment directly, for example `./.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest --version`. Do not recreate the environment merely because the shell is different.

Press Ctrl+Shift+P in VS Code, search for `Python: Select Interpreter` and select the Python inside `.venv`.

### 6.3 Install packages

```bat
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest --version
python -m playwright --version
```

Wait for installation before the version commands. No Playwright browser download is needed for the installed Chrome or Edge used here.

### 6.4 Choose your browser for this terminal

Run one command.

Edge:

```bat
set "TEST_BROWSER=msedge"
```

Chrome:

```bat
set "TEST_BROWSER=chrome"
```

Check:

```bat
echo %TEST_BROWSER%
```

You should see `msedge` or `chrome`. This setting lasts only for the current Command Prompt session.

If the variable prints literally or you are continuing in Git Bash, replace `%TEST_BROWSER%` with `chrome` or `msedge` in pytest and Codegen commands. Keep the respective option names: pytest uses `--browser-channel`; Codegen uses `--channel`. No changes to your tests or `pytest.ini` are needed.

For example, a pytest option becomes `--browser-channel chrome`, while a Codegen option becomes `--channel chrome`. Students whose variable works may retain the original syntax.

### 6.5 Create your member folders

Refer to the structure at the start. Create these in VS Code using your member number:

```text
tests/
reports/member-1/
recordings/member-1/
test-results/member-1/
docs/evidence/member-1/
```

Create these folders before the first test, especially `reports/member-1/`. If using Command Prompt, VS Code Explorer is sufficient. Alternatively, this Python command can be run in Command Prompt or Git Bash; replace the member number:

```text
python -c "from pathlib import Path; folders = ['tests', 'reports/member-1', 'recordings/member-1', 'test-results/member-1', 'docs/evidence/member-1']; [Path(folder).mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True) for folder in folders]"
```

Git does not store empty folders; generated files make them available to commit.

```bat
git status
git check-ignore .venv/
```

The environment should be ignored. Reports, recordings, results and selected evidence must not be ignored.

> [!TIP]
> On another day, reopen the project, activate `.venv` and set `TEST_BROWSER` again. Continue your existing branch; do not recreate it.

***

## 7. Explore and run your first test

### 7.1 Try the task list manually

Open [Playwright TodoMVC](https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/).

1. Enter `Read testing notes` in `What needs to be done?`.
2. Press Enter and find the task.
3. Select its checkbox.
4. Try All, Active and Completed.

The automated browser uses a separate session. You do not need to clear your usual browser's tasks.


#### Manual observation and built-in diagnostics

You chose actions and observed results yourself. Automation repeats predefined checks. Notice whether the completion control is easy to find: a task-count assertion cannot judge usability.

Right-click the task input and select Inspect. Compare its `placeholder` with `What needs to be done?`. Look at Console for messages; there may be no errors. Open Network and refresh once to see requests, then close Developer Tools. This is investigation, not a performance test.

### 7.2 Create your personal file


#### Identify the test parameters

| Parameter | Add-task example |
| --- | --- |
| Scenario | Add one valid task. |
| Condition | Fresh session and empty list. |
| Values | `Read testing notes`. |
| Description | Open, enter text and press Enter. |
| Expected outcome | One task with that text; input clears. |

Assertions turn expectations into checks. Actual results come from execution.


Member 1 creates `tests/test_member_1.py`. Use your number. Paste the complete code and save. Keep the indentation.

```python
from playwright.sync_api import Page, expect

URL = "https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/"


def test_add_task(page: Page):
    page.goto(URL)

    task_input = page.get_by_placeholder(
        "What needs to be done?",
        exact=True,
    )
    task_items = page.locator(".todo-list li")
    task_labels = task_items.locator("label")

    expect(task_items).to_have_count(0)

    task_input.fill("Read testing notes")
    task_input.press("Enter")

    expect(task_items).to_have_count(1)
    expect(task_labels).to_have_text(["Read testing notes"])
    expect(task_input).to_have_value("")
```

### 7.3 Run it

Ensure your member folders from Section 6.5 exist and save your Python file. From this first test onwards, generate screenshots, saved XML results and an HTML report together.

```bat
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py --browser-channel %TEST_BROWSER% --headed --slowmo 300 --output test-results/member-1/current-run --screenshot on --junitxml=reports/member-1/results.xml --html=reports/member-1/results.html --self-contained-html
```

The browser opens, adds the task and closes. If all checks succeed, the terminal reports `1 passed`.

If the variable is not working, use this equivalent Chrome command (Edge users substitute `msedge`):

```text
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py --browser-channel chrome --headed --slowmo 300 --screenshot on --output test-results/member-1/current-run --junitxml=reports/member-1/results.xml --html=reports/member-1/results.html --self-contained-html
```

After this first run, inspect all three outputs:

| Output | Location | What it means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Automatic PNG | Generated test subfolder inside `test-results/member-1/current-run/` | End-of-test browser screenshot, if browser/page setup succeeded. |
| XML results | `reports/member-1/results.xml` | Machine-readable outcomes, timings and failure/error information. |
| HTML report | `reports/member-1/results.html` | Human-readable test outcomes and diagnostics. |

Open the HTML report in File Explorer, then separately open the generated screenshot. The HTML does not automatically embed the PNG. XML is saved result data, not an image.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `--output` only selects a browser-artifact location. `--screenshot on` enables automatic screenshots, `--junitxml` saves XML results, and `--html` requests the HTML report. These are separate options.
>
> Each guided rerun updates `results.html` and `results.xml` with the tests selected in that command; it does not append history. A one-function run reports only that function. Section 13 reruns the full personal file for final submission. Reusing `current-run` can replace its browser artifacts.
>
> Syntax, collection, command-line or browser-launch errors may prevent screenshot generation. Read the terminal summary before assuming a missing PNG is a folder problem.

In Command Prompt, verify the files:

```bat
dir reports\member-1
dir /s /b test-results\member-1\current-run
```

In Git Bash, use:

```bash
ls reports/member-1
find test-results/member-1/current-run -type f
```

These commands do not retain traces. Tracing remains an optional investigation activity in Section 16.1.

| Code or option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `def test_add_task(...)` | Defines a test. pytest recognises `test_` function names. |
| `page` | A browser page supplied by the Playwright pytest package. |
| `page: Page` | A type hint that helps the editor understand `page`. |
| `page.goto(URL)` | Opens the website. |
| `get_by_placeholder(...)` | Finds the input by hint text. |
| `exact=True` | Requires the whole hint text to match. |
| `locator(".todo-list li")` | Finds task rows using a CSS selector. |
| `task_items.locator("label")` | Finds text labels in those rows. |
| `fill(...)` / `press("Enter")` | Enter text / submit it. |
| `to_have_count(...)` | Checks the number of rows. |
| `to_have_text([...])` | Checks expected labels. |
| `to_have_value("")` | Checks the input is empty. |
| `--headed` | Shows the browser. |
| `--slowmo 300` | Slows actions so you can watch. |
| `--screenshot on` | Requests an automatic end-of-test screenshot. |
| `--output ...` | Selects where browser artifacts are stored. |
| `--junitxml=...` | Saves structured XML test results. |
| `--html=...` | Creates the HTML report. |
| `--self-contained-html` | Keeps report styling/resources in the HTML; separate PNGs are not automatically attached. |

You can reuse the CSS selector without learning CSS first. Square brackets contain a list of expected labels. Playwright's page checks wait briefly for the expected condition; arbitrary pauses are not needed.

#### Optional before/during/after checkpoints

The automatic screenshot records the end of the test, not three intermediate states. If your instructor asks you to demonstrate checkpoints, add the following calls to the existing `test_add_task()` function. Keep your imports, `URL`, actions and assertions. Do not create a second function with the same name. Create your evidence folder first and use your own member number.

After `expect(task_items).to_have_count(0)`:

```python
    page.screenshot(
        path="docs/evidence/member-1/guided-add-task-before.png",
        full_page=True,
    )
```

After `task_input.fill("Read testing notes")`, before pressing Enter:

```python
    expect(task_input).to_have_value("Read testing notes")
    page.screenshot(
        path="docs/evidence/member-1/guided-add-task-during.png",
        full_page=True,
    )
```

After the final `expect(task_input).to_have_value("")` assertion:

```python
    page.screenshot(
        path="docs/evidence/member-1/guided-add-task-after.png",
        full_page=True,
    )
```

Keep the indentation inside the existing function. The after image is taken only after the checks pass. Rerun with Section 7.3's command. These explicit paths are independent of `--output`. They are supplementary guided evidence, not the two required additional-test PNGs. Already completed tests do not need to be retrofitted.

### 7.4 Commit and push

```bat
git add tests/test_member_1.py
git diff --staged
git commit -m "Add first task creation test"
git push -u origin testing/member-1
```

Use your filename and branch. The file is on your branch, not `main`, until merged.

***

## 8. Check task completion

Append below the first test, keeping earlier code:

```python
def test_complete_task(page: Page):
    page.goto(URL)

    task_input = page.get_by_placeholder(
        "What needs to be done?",
        exact=True,
    )
    task_items = page.locator(".todo-list li")

    expect(task_items).to_have_count(0)

    task_input.fill("Practise automated testing")
    task_input.press("Enter")

    expect(task_items).to_have_count(1)

    checkbox = task_items.first.get_by_role("checkbox")
    checkbox.check()
    expect(checkbox).to_be_checked()

    page.get_by_role("link", name="Completed", exact=True).click()

    expect(task_items).to_have_count(1)
    expect(task_items.locator("label")).to_have_text(
        ["Practise automated testing"]
    )
```

Save and run:

```bat
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py --browser-channel %TEST_BROWSER% --headed --output test-results/member-1/current-run --screenshot on --junitxml=reports/member-1/results.xml --html=reports/member-1/results.html --self-contained-html
```

If both succeed, the terminal reports `2 passed`.

`first` selects the first task row. `get_by_role("checkbox")` finds its checkbox. `check()` selects it, and `to_be_checked()` checks its state.

Each test gets a fresh browser session and creates its own task. It does not depend on an earlier test.

***

## 9. Run one test with different inputs

An empty or spaces-only task should not be added. This negative test passes when the list stays empty.

### Choose inputs for a reason

Equivalent testing, or equivalence partitioning, groups inputs expected to behave similarly. Meaningful text is accepted; empty and whitespace-only text form a rejection group. The three blank examples below are variations in one group, not three distinct boundaries.

Sampling does not prove every possible value behaves identically. Boundary testing checks at or near a defined limit. Do not invent an unstated maximum task length. Optional Section 16.8 explores lengths zero, one and two around minimum non-empty text.

### 9.1 Add an import

At the top of your file, keep existing code and add:

```python
import pytest
```

### 9.2 Append the test

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "task_text",
    ["", " ", "   "],
    ids=["empty", "one-space", "three-spaces"],
)
def test_blank_task_is_not_added(page: Page, task_text: str):
    page.goto(URL)

    task_input = page.get_by_placeholder(
        "What needs to be done?",
        exact=True,
    )
    task_items = page.locator(".todo-list li")

    expect(task_items).to_have_count(0)

    task_input.fill(task_text)
    task_input.press("Enter")

    expect(task_items).to_have_count(0)
```

The line starting with `@` runs the function once per input. This is parametrization.

| Part | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `""` | No characters. |
| `" "` | One space. |
| `"   "` | Three spaces. |
| `task_text` | Receives the current input. |
| `ids` | Gives each run a readable name. |
| `task_text: str` | A type hint saying the input is text. |

### 9.3 Run and commit

```bat
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py --browser-channel %TEST_BROWSER% --headed --output test-results/member-1/current-run --screenshot on --junitxml=reports/member-1/results.xml --html=reports/member-1/results.html --self-contained-html
```

Your two earlier tests and three input cases produce five runs. If all succeed, the terminal reports `5 passed`.

```bat
git add tests/test_member_1.py
git diff --staged
git commit -m "Add completion and blank input checks"
git push
```

***

## 10. Test a simple login

The task-list website has no login activity. Use [The Internet login demonstration](https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login).

### 10.1 Try the login manually

The page publishes these practice details:

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Username | `tomsmith` |
| Password | `SuperSecretPassword!` |

Open the page, enter the practice details, click Login and find the Secure Area heading.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> These are public demonstration details, not personal credentials. Use them only on this practice site. Copy capital letters and the final exclamation mark carefully.

### 10.2 Append a successful-login test

Add below existing tests:

```python
def test_login_with_correct_details(page: Page):
    page.goto("https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login")

    page.get_by_label("Username").fill("tomsmith")
    page.get_by_label("Password").fill("SuperSecretPassword!")
    page.get_by_role("button", name="Login").click()

    expect(
        page.get_by_role(
            "heading",
            name="Secure Area",
            exact=True,
        )
    ).to_be_visible()
```

| New code | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `get_by_label("Username")` | Find the field labelled Username. |
| `get_by_label("Password")` | Find the field labelled Password. |
| `get_by_role("button", name="Login")` | Find the Login button. |
| `get_by_role("heading", name="Secure Area", exact=True)` | Find the heading named exactly Secure Area. |
| `to_be_visible()` | Check it appears. |

Save and run only this test:

```bat
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py::test_login_with_correct_details --browser-channel %TEST_BROWSER% --headed --slowmo 300 --output test-results/member-1/current-run --screenshot on --junitxml=reports/member-1/results.xml --html=reports/member-1/results.html --self-contained-html
```

The name after `::` selects one function. A successful run reports `1 passed`.

### 10.3 Append an incorrect-password test

```python
def test_login_with_incorrect_password(page: Page):
    page.goto("https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login")

    page.get_by_label("Username").fill("tomsmith")
    page.get_by_label("Password").fill("WrongPassword123")
    page.get_by_role("button", name="Login").click()

    expect(
        page.get_by_text("Your password is invalid!")
    ).to_be_visible()

    expect(
        page.get_by_role("button", name="Login")
    ).to_be_visible()
```

This enters an incorrect password. Checks confirm the error appears and the Login button remains visible. The test passes when the website rejects the password.

### 10.4 Run all seven cases

```bat
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py --browser-channel %TEST_BROWSER% --headed --output test-results/member-1/current-run --screenshot on --junitxml=reports/member-1/results.xml --html=reports/member-1/results.html --self-contained-html
```

| Cases so far | Count |
| --- | ---: |
| Add a task | 1 |
| Complete a task | 1 |
| Blank inputs | 3 |
| Correct login | 1 |
| Incorrect password | 1 |
| Total | 7 |

If all succeed, the terminal reports `7 passed`. Each login test starts in its own fresh session and does not depend on the other.

```bat
git add tests/test_member_1.py
git diff --staged
git commit -m "Add correct and incorrect password login tests"
git push
```

***

## 11. Record and replay browser actions

### 11.1 Understand recording and replay

Codegen watches browser actions and creates Python code.

```text
Recording: You type and click → Codegen creates code
Replaying: You run the test → Playwright types and clicks
```

Use one scenario:

```text
Open the task list → Add “Try the recorder” → Check its text
```

Actions alone are not enough. An assertion checks the result.

### 11.2 Prepare the terminal

Use the project folder and active `.venv` in Command Prompt. Create `recordings/member-1/` first, using your number:

```bat
echo %TEST_BROWSER%
```

If needed, set it to `msedge` or `chrome` again. Check your `recordings/member-1/` folder exists.

### 11.3 Start Codegen

```bat
python -m playwright codegen --channel %TEST_BROWSER% --target python-pytest -o recordings/member-1/recorded_task.py https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/
```

Use your number.

| Part | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `codegen` | Start the recorder. |
| `--channel %TEST_BROWSER%` | Use your selected browser. |
| `--target python-pytest` | Create Python code for pytest. |
| `-o recordings/member-1/recorded_task.py` | Save generated code here. |
| Website address | Open this page. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Codegen uses `--channel`. pytest uses `--browser-channel`. These names are different.

### 11.4 Find the two windows

| Window | What to do |
| --- | --- |
| Browser opened by Codegen | Perform clicks and typing. |
| Playwright Inspector | Watch generated code. |

Move them so you can see both. Do not use another browser window for recording.

### 11.5 Record one task

1. Confirm the recording browser's list is empty.
2. Click `What needs to be done?`.
3. Type `Try the recorder`.
4. Press Enter.
5. Confirm it appears. Do not add more tasks.

Inspector should show navigation, input and Enter code. An extra click is fine.

### 11.6 Try recording a text check

1. Hover over toolbar buttons to read labels.
2. Find the text assertion control, usually `Assert text`.
3. Select it, then select `Try the recorder` on the page.
4. Confirm text if prompted.
5. Look for `expect(...)` in the code.

If the control is difficult to find, continue and add the check manually.

### 11.7 Finish and read the recording

Close the recording browser and Inspector. Wait for the terminal. Open `recordings/member-1/recorded_task.py` in VS Code.

Find the website address, entered text and Enter action. They may look like:

```python
page.get_by_placeholder("What needs to be done?").fill(
    "Try the recorder"
)
page.get_by_placeholder("What needs to be done?").press("Enter")
```

`get_by_placeholder()` finds the input, `fill()` enters text and `press()` submits it. Generated code may differ because Codegen can identify elements in different ways.

### 11.8 Make sure there is an assertion

If no task-text check exists, add inside the function after Enter:

```python
expect(page.locator(".todo-list li label")).to_have_text(
    ["Try the recorder"]
)
```

Match indentation and check `expect` is imported. If unsure, compare with this complete example or use it to replace the recording file:

```python
from playwright.sync_api import Page, expect


def test_recorded_task(page: Page):
    page.goto("https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc/")

    task_input = page.get_by_placeholder(
        "What needs to be done?",
        exact=True,
    )
    task_input.fill("Try the recorder")
    task_input.press("Enter")

    task_labels = page.locator(".todo-list li label")
    expect(task_labels).to_have_text(["Try the recorder"])
```

This checks labels against a list containing the expected task. Save the file.

### 11.9 Replay

The revised replay command saves `recording.html` and `recording.xml` in your report folder, separate from the main personal-suite report. It also requests automatic replay screenshots.

```bat
python -m pytest recordings/member-1/recorded_task.py --browser-channel %TEST_BROWSER% --headed --slowmo 300 --output test-results/member-1/recording-run --screenshot on --junitxml=reports/member-1/recording.xml --html=reports/member-1/recording.html --self-contained-html
```

The browser opens, enters the task, checks it and closes. If this one test succeeds, the terminal reports `1 passed`.

A successful run containing only actions does not explicitly check task text. Including an assertion checks the result.

Keep this recording in `recordings/member-1/`, using your number, and commit it. It does not increase the main case count under `tests/`; replay selects it explicitly.

> [!TIP]
> If replay fails, compare input and expected text, check only one task was added and use the complete example if needed. See Section 17.9 for recording problems.

***

## 12. Use a helper to add two tasks

A helper is simply a Python function used to repeat useful steps.

### 12.1 Add the helper

Put this helper and the test below in the same personal file. Both `def` lines start at the left edge, outside every other function. Save before running.

Append to your personal file, keeping existing code:

```python
def add_task(page: Page, task_name: str):
    task_input = page.get_by_placeholder(
        "What needs to be done?",
        exact=True,
    )
    task_input.fill(task_name)
    task_input.press("Enter")
```

`task_name` supplies the text. This function does not open the website or check results. Its name does not start with `test_`, so pytest does not treat it as a test.

### 12.2 Add the test

Append below the helper:

```python
def test_add_two_tasks(page: Page):
    page.goto(URL)
    task_items = page.locator(".todo-list li")

    expect(task_items).to_have_count(0)

    add_task(page, "Read the instructions")
    add_task(page, "Practise the examples")

    expect(task_items).to_have_count(2)
    expect(task_items.locator("label")).to_have_text(
        ["Read the instructions", "Practise the examples"]
    )
```

This opens the page, calls the helper twice and checks count and names. A count alone does not confirm the names.

### 12.3 Run all eight cases

```bat
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py --browser-channel %TEST_BROWSER% --headed --output test-results/member-1/current-run --screenshot on --junitxml=reports/member-1/results.xml --html=reports/member-1/results.html --self-contained-html
```

If all succeed, the summary reports `8 passed`. The helper is not an extra case; the two-task test adds one.

```bat
git add tests/test_member_1.py
git diff --staged
git commit -m "Add helper and two task creation test"
git push
```


### 12.4 Create two different tests of your own

Allow about 20 minutes. Each member creates two additional tests in their personal file. Start with one, then the second. Each needs meaningful assertions and a final-result PNG from your own execution.

Go beyond the eight guided cases. Your two choices should check different behaviours or conditions. Prefer different scenarios across the group. If repetition is genuinely unavoidable, document the reason and meaningful implementation differences. Code and PNGs must be produced independently; cosmetic renaming is not sufficient.

#### Step 1: Agree and record two choices

Use `docs/test-plan.md` from setup. Nominate one person to update it if choices change rather than editing it on many branches.

| Idea | What makes it different | Possible result to check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Save an edit with Enter | Updates an existing task. | New name appears; old name is gone. |
| Cancel an edit with Escape | Cancels rather than saves. | Original name remains. |
| Delete an active task | Removes an unfinished item. | Selected item disappears; another remains. |
| Delete a completed task | Removes a finished item. | Selected completed item is absent. |
| Clear completed tasks from a mixed list | Removes finished items together. | Active tasks remain; completed tasks are gone. |
| Mark all complete | Uses the whole-list control. | All prepared tasks are completed. |
| Mark all active again | Reverses whole-list completion. | Prepared checkboxes are no longer selected. |
| Active filter with mixed items | Excludes completed tasks. | Only unfinished names appear. |
| Completed filter with mixed items | Goes beyond the guided one-task case. | Only completed names appear. |
| Return to All from a filtered list | Restores the whole display. | All prepared names reappear. |
| Refresh after adding tasks | Checks persistence within one session. | Added names remain after reload. |
| Repeated names | Checks duplicate handling. | Both expected rows remain. |
| Leading/trailing spaces | Checks normalization, not just wording. | Displayed text follows observed and agreed trimming behaviour. |
| Incorrect username with practice password | Another login rejection condition. | Username error appears; login is not completed. |

These are ideas, not guaranteed outcomes for future public-site versions. Try the behaviour manually and confirm the expectation. If unclear, choose a clearer scenario or state the assumption honestly.

For five members, aim for ten distinct choices. Use the exception only when genuinely necessary; a member's own two choices should still differ.

#### Step 2: Try your first scenario manually

Open the relevant practice site. Perform the actions, observe results and decide which assertions will check them. Keep it small. Use fictional tasks and public demonstration login details only.

#### Step 3: Identify test parameters

Use short comments if useful:

```text
Scenario: Active shows unfinished tasks only.
Condition: Fresh session and empty list.
Values: “Read a chapter” and “Write a summary”.
Description: Add both, complete the first, then select Active.
Expected outcome: Only “Write a summary” appears.
```

This is a plan, not Python code.

#### Step 4: Start a new function

Append to your personal file with a unique name:

```python
def test_active_filter_shows_unfinished_task(page: Page):
    page.goto(URL)

    # Add your setup and actions.

    # Add meaningful assertions.

    # Capture your final PNG after the assertions.
```

This skeleton is not finished. Without assertions it may pass while checking nothing useful. Keep `def` at the left edge and indent instructions by four spaces. Preserve earlier imports, `URL`, helper and guided tests.

#### Step 5: Reuse familiar patterns

| Need | Pattern |
| --- | --- |
| Open task list | `page.goto(URL)` |
| Add task | `add_task(page, "A fictional task")` |
| Find rows | `page.locator(".todo-list li")` |
| Complete a task | Checkbox actions from Section 8. |
| Change a filter | Completed-link action with the intended link name. |
| Check count | `expect(task_items).to_have_count(...)` |
| Check labels | `expect(task_items.locator("label")).to_have_text([...])` |

Replace `...` with expected values. If using `add_task()`, its complete helper must be in this file; it is not built into Playwright.

Each test receives a fresh session. Prepare everything it needs inside the test. Codegen can help find actions, but read the code and add useful assertions.

#### Step 6: Capture a PNG after the checks

Create your member evidence folder. Inside the first new function, after relevant assertions:

```python
page.screenshot(
    path="docs/evidence/member-1/extra-test-1-active-filter.png",
    full_page=True,
)
```

For the second function choose another descriptive path:

```python
page.screenshot(
    path="docs/evidence/member-1/extra-test-2-delete-task.png",
    full_page=True,
)
```

Use your number and scenario names. These are snippets, not complete functions. Match indentation. `full_page=True` captures the full scrollable page.

An earlier failed assertion prevents the screenshot call running. Fix and rerun. An old image may remain after a failed run: confirm the current test passed and the image updated.

Each additional test needs at least one final-result PNG. Add an intermediate image only if useful, with another filename. Do not use another member's image.

For supplementary before/during evidence, follow Section 7.3's placement pattern: capture the checked starting state, then a meaningful checked intermediate state. Use distinct paths such as `extra-test-1-before.png` and `extra-test-1-during.png`; use `extra-test-2-...` for the second scenario. Keep your existing final-result PNG filename as the after capture. These supplementary images do not change the original submission requirement.

#### Step 7: Run each new test individually

Save with Ctrl+S. Use your number and actual function name:

```bat
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py::test_active_filter_shows_unfinished_task --browser-channel %TEST_BROWSER% --headed --slowmo 300 --output test-results/member-1/current-run --screenshot on --junitxml=reports/member-1/results.xml --html=reports/member-1/results.html --self-contained-html
```

Watch, read the result and inspect the PNG. If it fails, inspect the failing line, page, actions and expected values. Change one thing at a time. Do not remove checks just to pass.

Write and run the second scenario with its own name, setup and assertions. Confirm choices with your group; for necessary repetition, confirm the reason and meaningful code differences.

Use one ordinary function per additional scenario here. Save more parametrization for optional practice.

#### Step 8: Run the full file and inspect both PNGs

```bat
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py --browser-channel %TEST_BROWSER% --headed --output test-results/member-1/current-run --screenshot on --junitxml=reports/member-1/results.xml --html=reports/member-1/results.html --self-contained-html
```

Eight guided cases and two new functions give ten executions. If successful, expect `10 passed`. Do not add dummy or assertion-free tests just to reach ten.

Open both PNGs and check intended results, readability and practice data only. Use different filenames; rerunning a call replaces the image at its path.

If more time is needed, finish both tests and PNGs after the lesson before merging. Clearly label unfinished drafts in your own recording folder. Do not present them as completed tests.

#### Step 9: Share source and your own outputs

After Section 13 produces your final report and results, inspect files and add only your member-owned paths:

```bat
git add tests/test_member_1.py
git add reports/member-1/
git add recordings/member-1/
git add test-results/member-1/
git add docs/evidence/member-1/
git diff --staged
git status
git commit -m "Add individual tests, outputs and PNG evidence"
git push
```

Use your number after files exist. Open images directly because a text diff does not show visual contents. Identify both scenarios and PNG paths in the PR. For unavoidable repeats, identify the reason and meaningful implementation differences.

Recordings, reports and results must also come from your own execution. Do not upload another member's outputs as yours.

***

## 13. Create a report and capture screenshots

### Why rerun earlier checks?

Regression testing checks existing behaviour after changes. In real projects, tests can rerun after releases. Here, rerunning after test-code changes also confirms the collection works. We do not control public-site releases, so this is not a controlled before-and-after application-change experiment.

### 13.1 Produce your final report and results

Reports, XML results and automatic screenshots have been generated since Section 7.3. This is the final full-file run: it replaces the latest working report with results covering your completed personal test file and saves browser artifacts under `main-run`.

Save your file and create `reports/member-1/` if missing. Use your own member number:

```bat
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py --browser-channel %TEST_BROWSER% --screenshot on --output test-results/member-1/main-run --html=reports/member-1/results.html --self-contained-html --junitxml=reports/member-1/results.xml
```

| Option | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--screenshot on` | Capture each test's final page, pass or fail. |
| `--output ...` | Choose your own generated-output folder. |
| `--junitxml=...` | Save machine-readable XML test results. |
| `--html=...` | Create your report. |
| `--self-contained-html` | Put supporting report-page resources in the HTML file; separately saved PNGs are not automatically embedded. |

Without `--headed`, the browser is not displayed. Add it to watch. The two explicit screenshot calls also update selected PNGs under `docs/evidence/`.

### 13.2 Inspect your outputs

1. Open `reports/member-1/results.html` in File Explorer.
2. Find names, outcomes, durations and errors. Confirm the report covers the full personal file, not only the last individual test.
3. Confirm `reports/member-1/results.xml` also exists. It contains structured results, not screenshots.
4. Open generated test folders under `test-results/member-1/main-run` in VS Code.
5. Compare correct-login and incorrect-password screenshots.
6. Open both additional-test PNGs in `docs/evidence/member-1/`.
7. Read the recording in `recordings/member-1/`.

A screenshot shows the page, not the whole desktop or terminal. Compare actual results with expectations. Investigate failures before calling them application defects.

### 13.3 What to upload

| Location | Share through Git? |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/test_member_1.py` | Yes: source. |
| `reports/member-1/` | Yes: generated HTML report and XML results. |
| `recordings/member-1/` | Yes: recording. |
| `test-results/member-1/` | Yes: your generated results. |
| `docs/evidence/member-1/` | Yes: selected PNG evidence. |
| `.venv/`, caches and `.env` | No: local and ignored. |

Add only your member paths, not the entire shared trees. Inspect for private data, including page and network information in traces. Keep actual failures labelled honestly.

### 13.4 Protect output folders

A run can clear its chosen output directory. Never use top-level `test-results/` or another member's folder as `--output`.

Use your run folders:

```text
test-results/member-1/current-run/
test-results/member-1/recording-run/
test-results/member-1/main-run/
test-results/member-1/failure-run/
```

Reuse a name when deliberately replacing that run. Use another descriptive name if preserving previous results. Avoid unnecessary duplicates.

The shared fallback `.pytest_cache/browser-output` is local and ignored. Explicit member paths are the results you share.

### 13.5 Commit the contribution

Use Section 12.4 Step 9 after inspection. Earlier source commits remain; the next commit records outputs and later changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Assertions check behaviour. Images support understanding but do not replace assertions or independently prove a pass. An image may be stale after a later failure.


***

## 14. Combine the group files

Share source, recordings, reports, generated results and selected PNGs. Tests are started manually: no GitHub Actions or other CI/CD workflow is configured. The slides show how tests could later support continuous testing.

### 14.1 Check and push

```bat
git status
git push
```

For intended uncommitted files, use Section 12.4 Step 9, inspect, commit and push. Do not add environments, caches, private data or another member's outputs.

### 14.2 Open and merge your PR

1. Open a GitHub PR from your branch to `main`.
2. Use a title such as `Add Member 1 tests and outputs`.
3. Look through Files changed with another member.
4. Confirm the eight guided cases and two additional functions remain and match planned scenarios.
5. For necessary repetition, confirm the reason and meaningful code differences in `docs/test-plan.md`.
6. Open the report, recording and both PNGs. Confirm outputs came from that member's execution and contain only practice data.
7. Check no other member's files were overwritten and no environment or cache files appear.
8. Merge one PR at a time.

### 14.3 Everyone: update main

Start clean. Commit intended source and outputs before switching:

```bat
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git status
```

Merged source and member outputs should now appear. A GitHub merge does not automatically update your computer.

### 14.4 Run the group suite once

Choose one runner. Create `reports/group/` and run:

```bat
python -m pytest --browser-channel %TEST_BROWSER% --output test-results/group-run --html=reports/group/results.html --self-contained-html --screenshot on --junitxml=reports/group/results.xml
```

These are separate generated-output paths, not a member's results folder. The revised group command also requests automatic screenshots and XML results. Inspect `reports/group/results.html`, `reports/group/results.xml` and the generated browser artifacts under `test-results/group-run/`.

| Members | Executions before optional additions |
| --- | ---: |
| 3 | 30 |
| 4 | 40 |
| 5 | 50 |

Each personal file contributes eight guided cases plus two additional functions. Optional or parametrized additions change the count. Execution count is not unique coverage: guided cases deliberately repeat, and permitted repeats do not automatically add new behaviour coverage.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Additional tests have explicit screenshot paths under each member's `docs/evidence/`. A combined run can overwrite those PNGs in the runner's local copy even with a separate `--output`: those paths are controlled by code.
>
> Every member captures and commits their own evidence before merging. Do not commit regenerated images as another member's original evidence. Run `git status` after the group run and inspect changes. Preserve committed original captures; do not blindly add every modified file.

If retaining group outputs, the nominated runner adds only group paths on a new branch, commits and combines through a PR:

```bat
git add reports/group/
git add test-results/group-run/
```

Avoid repeated whole-suite runs without a reason. Diagnose by failing file and function, fix on a branch and combine through a PR. Continue longer investigation after the lesson if needed.


***

## 15. Simple syntax reference

Refer to this as needed; you do not need to memorise it.

### Find something

| Syntax | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `page.get_by_label("Username")` | Find a field by its label. |
| `page.get_by_placeholder("What needs to be done?")` | Find an input by hint text. |
| `page.get_by_role("button", name="Login")` | Find a button by name. |
| `page.get_by_role("link", name="Completed")` | Find a link by name. |
| `page.get_by_role("heading", name="Secure Area")` | Find a heading by name. |
| `page.get_by_text("Your password is invalid!")` | Find an element containing this text. |
| `page.locator(".todo-list li")` | Find task rows with the supplied selector. |

### Perform an action

| Syntax | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `page.goto("https://example.com")` | Open a website. |
| `field.fill("Some text")` | Replace field text. |
| `field.press("Enter")` | Press Enter in that field. |
| `button.click()` | Click the button. |
| `checkbox.check()` | Select the checkbox. |

The variable names above need locators assigned first. For example:

```python
username_field = page.get_by_label("Username")
username_field.fill("tomsmith")
```

The same action on one line:

```python
page.get_by_label("Username").fill("tomsmith")
```

### Check a result

| Syntax | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `expect(item).to_be_visible()` | Check the item is visible. |
| `expect(checkbox).to_be_checked()` | Check the checkbox is selected. |
| `expect(items).to_have_count(1)` | Check exactly one item matches. |
| `expect(labels).to_have_text(["Read testing notes"])` | Check labels match this expected list. |
| `expect(field).to_have_value("")` | Check the input is empty. |

```text
expect(something).check_the_expected_result()
```

***

## 16. Optional post-lesson practice

Suggested times are planning guides, not limits.

| Activity | Suggested time | Focus |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 16.1 Investigate a deliberate failure | 15–20 minutes | Errors, screenshots and traces. |
| 16.2 Capture a page at a chosen step | 5–10 minutes | Screenshot code. |
| 16.3 Add a logout test | 10–15 minutes | Login followed by logout. |
| 16.4 Add input examples | 10–15 minutes | Parametrization. |
| 16.5 Try another browser | 10–15 minutes, plus downloads | Reuse tests. |
| 16.6 Improve a recording | 15–20 minutes | Useful shared code. |
| 16.7 Inspect page elements and history | 10 minutes | Connect locators and changes. |

Before changing source again, update clean `main` and create a new branch:

```bat
git switch main
git pull --ff-only origin main
git switch -c practice/member-1-follow-up
```

Use your number. Continue that branch on later sessions rather than recreating it. Run personal tests after changes, then commit, push and combine through a PR.

### 16.1 Investigate a deliberate failure

Temporarily change the task-text expectation in `test_add_task()` to:

```python
expect(task_labels).to_have_text(["A different task"])
```

Do not change input. Run:

```bat
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py::test_add_task --browser-channel %TEST_BROWSER% --headed --screenshot only-on-failure --tracing retain-on-failure --output test-results/member-1/failure-run --junitxml=reports/member-1/failure.xml --html=reports/member-1/failure.html --self-contained-html
```

This investigation writes `failure.html` and `failure.xml`, preserving the main `results.html` / `results.xml` report pair. Failure-only automatic screenshots remain intentional for this activity.

The test should fail because input and expectation differ. Find both in the error. Here the expectation is wrong; the failure does not demonstrate a website defect.

Open the generated test subfolder inside `test-results/member-1/failure-run` and its screenshot. Find `trace.zip`, right-click and Copy Relative Path. Replace the placeholder:

```bat
python -m playwright show-trace "PASTE_RELATIVE_PATH_HERE"
```

Look through navigation, text entry, Enter and the failed check. Restore:

```python
expect(task_labels).to_have_text(["Read testing notes"])
```

Save and rerun your file. Eight guided cases plus two completed additional functions give `10 passed` if successful. Optional additions change the count.

```bat
git diff
```

If restored exactly, no extra commit may be needed. Never commit the deliberate mistake or delete the assertion to hide it.

### 16.2 Capture a page at a chosen step

Create your member evidence folder if missing. Put this inside the correct-login test after its heading assertion. This is optional extra evidence, not one of the two required additional-test PNGs:

```python
page.screenshot(
    path="docs/evidence/member-1/login-success-practice.png",
    full_page=True,
)
```

Match indentation and use your number. `path` gives the filename; `full_page=True` captures the full scrollable page. An earlier failed assertion prevents this line running, so automatic failure screenshots remain useful. Rerunning replaces this image.

### 16.3 Add a logout test

Append a new test, keeping existing imports and tests:

```python
def test_logout_after_login(page: Page):
    page.goto("https://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login")

    page.get_by_label("Username").fill("tomsmith")
    page.get_by_label("Password").fill("SuperSecretPassword!")
    page.get_by_role("button", name="Login").click()

    expect(
        page.get_by_role("heading", name="Secure Area", exact=True)
    ).to_be_visible()

    page.get_by_role("link", name="Logout").click()

    expect(page.get_by_label("Username")).to_be_visible()
    expect(page.get_by_label("Password")).to_be_visible()
    expect(page.get_by_role("button", name="Login")).to_be_visible()
```

This logs in for itself and adds one case.

### 16.4 Add a blank-input example

Replace only the parametrization block above the blank-input function:

```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize(
    "task_text",
    ["", " ", "   ", "    "],
    ids=["empty", "one-space", "three-spaces", "four-spaces"],
)
```

Keep the function unchanged. There is one ID per input. This adds one case; your total depends on other additions.

### 16.5 Try another browser

For the other installed main browser, change `TEST_BROWSER` and rerun.

For managed browsers, these commands override shared `addopts` for that run. Do not attach Chrome or Edge channels to Firefox or WebKit.

Chromium:

```bat
python -m playwright install chromium
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py -o "addopts=-v" --browser chromium --headed --output test-results/member-1/current-run --screenshot on --junitxml=reports/member-1/results.xml --html=reports/member-1/results.html --self-contained-html
```

Firefox:

```bat
python -m playwright install firefox
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py -o "addopts=-v" --browser firefox --headed --output test-results/member-1/current-run --screenshot on --junitxml=reports/member-1/results.xml --html=reports/member-1/results.html --self-contained-html
```

WebKit:

```bat
python -m playwright install webkit
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py -o "addopts=-v" --browser webkit --headed --output test-results/member-1/current-run --screenshot on --junitxml=reports/member-1/results.xml --html=reports/member-1/results.html --self-contained-html
```

Ordinary Firefox does not replace Playwright Firefox. Playwright WebKit is not installed Safari. Skip unsupported or blocked options. Compare functional results, not browser speed. After upgrading Playwright, reinstall managed browsers if used, not ordinary Chrome or Edge.

### 16.6 Improve a recording

Try editing or deleting a task manually. Record it, read the code, remove unnecessary actions and add an assertion.

Keep experiments in your member-owned recordings folder, clearly labelling unfinished drafts. Promote working code into your personal test file using a unique name, then run, commit and push source, recording and relevant own outputs through a PR. If expected behaviour is unclear, treat it as an observation rather than a confirmed defect.

### 16.7 Inspect elements and history

Right-click the task input and select Inspect. Find `placeholder="What needs to be done?"` and compare it with `get_by_placeholder(...)`.

```bat
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all -15
```

Use an actual commit ID:

```bat
git show COMMIT_ID
```

Press `q` if Git opens a scrolling view.


### 16.8 Explore minimum-length boundary examples

Compare lengths zero, one and two around minimum non-empty text. Do not invent an unstated maximum.

| Input | Length | Expected result for this exercise |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `""` | 0 | No task added. |
| `"A"` | 1 | Task A appears. |
| `"AB"` | 2 | Task AB appears. |

Try manually, then reuse earlier patterns. Whitespace-only input is another validation consideration. Repeating the empty case adds an execution, not new behaviour. Commit your own results after inspection.

### 16.9 Compare a built-in Python tool

Create `examples/builtin_unittest_example.py`:

```python
import unittest


def clean_task_name(text: str):
    return text.strip()


class TestCleanTaskName(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_removes_outer_spaces(self):
        self.assertEqual(clean_task_name("  Read notes  "), "Read notes")

    def test_keeps_normal_text(self):
        self.assertEqual(clean_task_name("Read notes"), "Read notes")

    def test_spaces_become_empty_text(self):
        self.assertEqual(clean_task_name("   "), "")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

Run:

```bat
python examples/builtin_unittest_example.py
```

`self.assertEqual(actual, expected)` compares values. `unittest.TestCase` supplies checks; `self` refers to the current test object. Three passing checks report three tests and `OK`.

No browser opens. This checks a local function, not TodoMVC's implementation, and does not change the browser-case count. It contrasts built-in local testing with external browser tools. The separate pytest self-help guide provides more local-function practice.

***

## 17. Troubleshooting common errors

Use this section when a step does not work. You do not need to read it all before starting.

### 17.1 Start with five checks

1. Save the file with Ctrl+S.
2. Read the error before changing anything.
3. Check you are in the cloned project folder.
4. Check Python is running from `.venv`.
5. Check your branch and chosen browser.

In Command Prompt:

```bat
cd
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
git status
echo %TEST_BROWSER%
```

Expected:

| Check | Expected result |
| --- | --- |
| Folder | Your cloned project folder, not its parent or just `tests`. |
| Python | A path containing this project's `.venv\Scripts\python.exe`. |
| Git | Your intended branch and a list of current changes. |
| Browser | `chrome` or `msedge`. |

Change one thing at a time, then rerun only the affected test. Do not repeatedly run the entire group suite while diagnosing one problem.

### 17.2 Python is not recognised

You may see:

```text
'python' is not recognized as an internal or external command
```

Meaning: Windows cannot find Python through that command.

Try:

1. Close and reopen VS Code after installation.
2. Run `py -3 --version`.
3. If that works, create the environment with `py -3 -m venv .venv`.
4. Activate it and run `python --version` again.
5. If neither works, review the approved Python installation from Section 1.

If `python` opens the Microsoft Store instead, use the working Python launcher or approved installation rather than assuming Python is ready.

### 17.3 Environment activation or package import fails

#### Activation path cannot be found

Check your folder with `cd` and confirm `.venv` exists in VS Code. If it has not been created, run the environment-creation step once.

Use Command Prompt:

```bat
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

If PowerShell reports scripts are disabled, open Command Prompt instead. Do not change execution policy for this practical.

Alternatively run the environment's Python directly:

```bat
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pytest --version
```

#### `No module named pytest` or `No module named playwright`

Meaning: the Python being used cannot find the package.

```bat
python -c "import sys; print(sys.executable)"
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Check the Python path first. If wrong, activate `.venv` and repeat. In VS Code, also select the interpreter inside `.venv`.

#### `unrecognized arguments: --browser-channel ...` or `--screenshot ...`

Check that `pytest-playwright` is installed in this environment:

```bat
python -m pip show pytest-playwright
```

If missing, repeat installation from `requirements.txt`.

If `--html` or `--self-contained-html` is unrecognised, check:

```bat
python -m pip show pytest-html
```

Install the listed requirements in the active environment. Do not remove useful options just to silence the error.

### 17.4 Browser choice is rejected

You may see:

```text
argument --browser: invalid choice: 'chrome'
```

Meaning: a browser channel was supplied where pytest expects a browser family.

Check `pytest.ini`:

```ini
[pytest]
testpaths = tests
addopts = -v --browser chromium --output .pytest_cache/browser-output
```

Then use:

```bat
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py --browser-channel chrome --headed --output test-results/member-1/current-run --screenshot on --junitxml=reports/member-1/results.xml --html=reports/member-1/results.html --self-contained-html
```

For Edge, replace `chrome` with `msedge`. Both use the `chromium` family.

With the guide's variable:

```bat
set "TEST_BROWSER=chrome"
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py --browser-channel %TEST_BROWSER% --headed --output test-results/member-1/current-run --screenshot on --junitxml=reports/member-1/results.xml --html=reports/member-1/results.html --self-contained-html
```

Do not write `--browser %TEST_BROWSER%`.

### 17.5 Browser variable or executable is missing

#### Variable prints as `%TEST_BROWSER%`

Run one of these in the same Command Prompt terminal:

```bat
set "TEST_BROWSER=chrome"
```

or:

```bat
set "TEST_BROWSER=msedge"
```

Then `echo %TEST_BROWSER%` should show the value. Set it again whenever you open a new terminal. If the terminal uses PowerShell or Git Bash, open Command Prompt and activate your existing environment.

Alternatively, keep your active environment and replace `%TEST_BROWSER%` with `chrome` or `msedge` in the execution commands. For pytest retain `--browser-channel`; for Codegen retain `--channel`. Do not change your tests or recreate `.venv`.

#### Chrome or Edge executable cannot be found

1. Confirm the chosen stable browser opens from Windows Start.
2. Check the channel is `chrome` or `msedge`, with correct spelling.
3. If unavailable, use the other installed and approved browser.
4. Use approved installation methods if a browser needs installing.

#### Error points to missing Playwright Chromium

For the main activities, check you included the installed-browser channel. You do not need to download managed Chromium just to repair an omitted channel.

- pytest: `--browser-channel %TEST_BROWSER%`
- Codegen: `--channel %TEST_BROWSER%`

#### Browser is blocked by policy

Use an approved alternative or approved IT process. Do not bypass browser policies or disable security controls.

### 17.6 No tests or the wrong number of tests

#### `file or directory not found`

Check the current project folder, `tests` folder, member number and exact filename. Make sure it is `.py`, not `.py.txt`.

#### `no tests ran`

1. Save the file.
2. Confirm the file is named `test_member_1.py`, using your number.
3. Confirm test functions begin with `test_`.
4. Confirm they are not accidentally indented inside another function.
5. Confirm you are running the intended file.

List cases without opening a browser:

```bat
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py --collect-only
```

#### Unexpected number of cases

With only the main examples, expect:

```text
Add one task                         1
Complete one task                    1
Blank inputs                         3
Correct login                        1
Incorrect password                   1
Add two tasks                        1
Total                                8
```

Check you kept earlier tests when appending code. Each function in one file must have a different name; a later duplicate definition can replace an earlier one. The helper `add_task` is not a test. The two additional functions bring the personal total to ten before optional additions.

Optional tests increase the total. Running without a filename selects the group suite, not just your file. The separate recording is not included by the configured `testpaths = tests`.

### 17.7 Python code errors

| Error | Meaning | What to check |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `IndentationError` | Leading spaces are incorrect. | Use four spaces inside functions and match the complete example. |
| `SyntaxError` | Python cannot read the code structure. | Check missing quotes, brackets, colons and copied Markdown backticks. |
| `NameError: name 'expect' is not defined` | The assertion tool was not imported. | Keep `from playwright.sync_api import Page, expect` at the top. |
| `NameError: name 'pytest' is not defined` | Parametrization needs the pytest import. | Add `import pytest` at the top. |
| `NameError: name 'URL' is not defined` | The shared website variable is missing. | Keep the provided `URL = ...` line above the tests. |
| `NameError: name 'add_task' is not defined` | The helper is missing, misspelled or nested. | Keep the complete helper in the same file with `def` at the left edge; save and rerun. |
| `fixture 'task_text' not found` | pytest is not receiving parameter values. | Keep the `@pytest.mark.parametrize(...)` block immediately above the correct function and match `task_text` in both. |

Fix the indicated line, but also inspect the line immediately above it. An unclosed bracket or quote can cause the next line to be reported.

### 17.8 Page, locator, login or assertion failures

#### Navigation error or page cannot load

1. Open the exact practice URL manually.
2. Check internet access and approved network settings.
3. If the demonstration site is unavailable, save and retry later.
4. Do not invent a passing result or change to an unrelated website.

#### `TimeoutError` while finding or using an element

Meaning: Playwright did not complete an action before its time limit.

Check:

1. Did the correct page load?
2. Does the locator text match the actual page?
3. Did the preceding action reach the expected page?
4. Is a site error or network problem showing instead?

Run only the affected test visibly. For example:

```bat
python -m pytest tests/test_member_1.py::test_login_with_correct_details --browser-channel %TEST_BROWSER% --headed --slowmo 300 --output test-results/member-1/current-run --screenshot on --junitxml=reports/member-1/results.xml --html=reports/member-1/results.html --self-contained-html
```

Do not immediately add `time.sleep()` or increase timeouts. First find what the test is waiting for.

#### `strict mode violation` or multiple matching elements

Meaning: an action or single-element check expected one match but found several.

Use the exact role, label or supplied selector from the example. Check extra tasks were not recorded. Use `exact=True` when the example uses it. Do not blindly add `.first` to hide ambiguity.

#### Assertion says expected text differs

Compare input and expected text, including capital letters and spaces. Keep an honest expectation: do not delete the assertion or copy an incorrect result into it just to pass.

#### Correct-login test fails

Check the page is the demonstration login page and the exact values are:

```text
Username: tomsmith
Password: SuperSecretPassword!
```

The final `!` matters. Check the browser's displayed result and terminal error.

#### Incorrect-password test reports passed

This is expected if the website rejected the password and the assertions succeeded. A negative test is not supposed to report a failure when the website behaves correctly.

### 17.9 Recording problems

| Problem | What to try |
| --- | --- |
| Codegen rejects `--browser-channel` | Use Codegen's `--channel` option instead. |
| Recorder opens but no code appears | Use the browser opened by Codegen and check recording is active. |
| Cannot find Assert text | Use the manual assertion and complete example in Section 11.8. |
| Recording adds extra tasks | Remove accidental repeated actions or start a new short recording. |
| Recording replay fails but manual actions worked | Read the generated actions and assertion; check text, order and extra steps. |
| Recorder file missing | Check `recordings` exists, the member number and the output path in the command. |
| Terminal will not accept a new command | Finish and close recording windows first; the recorder may still be running. |

The recorder generates starting code, not a guaranteed complete test. Read it and include a useful check.

### 17.10 Reports, screenshots and trace problems

| Problem | Meaning and next step |
| --- | --- |
| No browser window while creating a report | Expected when `--headed` is omitted. Read the terminal result. |
| Browser closes after the test | Normal cleanup. The result remains in the terminal and generated outputs. |
| No screenshot for a passing test | All revised browser-run commands request screenshots. If using an older copied command, add `--screenshot on`; confirm browser execution succeeded. |
| Empty output folder with an older command | `--output` alone does not enable artifacts. Use the complete revised Section 7.3 command. |
| No saved XML results | Check the `--junitxml=...` path and that pytest started successfully. |
| Report contains only one test | An individual-function run replaced the latest report. Run the full personal file for submission. |
| No screenshot after a command-line or syntax error | Browser execution may never have started. Fix setup or code errors first. |
| HTML report contains no screenshot | Open separate images under `test-results`. They are not embedded automatically; this is not itself a failed report. |
| Cannot find output | Check the `--output` and `--html` paths and member number. |
| Old report still displayed | Check the latest run completed and reopen or refresh the correct local file. |
| Earlier screenshots disappeared | Later runs can replace browser output. Copy locally first if you need to keep it. |
| No `trace.zip` | Use `--tracing retain-on-failure` and reproduce a failure. A passing run does not retain a failure-only trace. |
| Trace path contains spaces | Put the full copied path in quotation marks. |
| Handwritten screenshot line did not run | A failed earlier assertion may have stopped execution before it. Use automatic failure screenshots. |

If a report folder is missing, create `reports/member-1/` using your own member number, then rerun the complete revised command. Do not move outputs into `tests` just to make them visible.

#### Shared output and PNG problems

| Problem | What to check |
| --- | --- |
| Selected PNG missing | Create the evidence folder; confirm the test reached its screenshot call after assertions. |
| Image exists but latest run failed | It may be stale. Fix, rerun and confirm its update. |
| Only one PNG remains | Use separate filenames for the two tests. |
| Output file ignored | Correct obsolete shared ignore rules, then add your own paths. |
| Group run changed evidence | Do not commit regenerated files as another member's original evidence. Inspect committed originals. |

### 17.11 Git identity, access and branch problems

#### `Author identity unknown`

Set the commit identity from Section 1.4 with your own details, then retry the commit. Do not use another member's identity.

#### `not a git repository`

You are outside the cloned repository. Open the actual project folder in VS Code and a new terminal. Run `git status` again.

#### `repository not found` or authentication failed

Check the copied HTTPS URL, GitHub sign-in and accepted collaborator invitation. Repository access and Git commit identity are different settings.

#### Branch already exists

If continuing your existing work, select rather than recreate it:

```bat
git switch testing/member-1
```

Use `git status` first and your number. Do not delete the branch simply to repeat an earlier command.

#### Branch has no upstream

For the first push on your personal branch:

```bat
git push -u origin testing/member-1
```

Later pushes on that branch can use `git push`.

#### `nothing to commit`

Save your file. Check `git status` and `git diff`. It may already be committed, unchanged or ignored. Select the intended source file with `git add` only if it has changes.

#### Push rejected because the remote contains new work

Stop and inspect:

```bat
git status
git branch --show-current
git fetch origin
git log --oneline --graph --decorate --all -15
```

Confirm no one else is using your personal branch. Coordinate before combining remote changes. Do not force-push or delete local work to bypass rejection.

#### Merged files do not appear locally

From clean local `main`:

```bat
git pull --ff-only origin main
```

A merge on GitHub does not update computers automatically.

### 17.12 Ignore rules and shared outputs

Reports, recordings and results must be shared in member folders. If ignored by old rules, the coordinator removes those entries from the shared `.gitignore` and commits the correction once. Members update before adding their outputs. Do not force-add to bypass an unresolved policy mismatch.

Check an existing file's ignore rule:

```bat
git check-ignore -v reports/member-1/results.html
```

Inspect any reported rule, including a global rule if present. The environment checks below still apply:


```bat
git check-ignore -v .venv/
```

If no rule appears, check `.gitignore` is saved in the project root and is not `.gitignore.txt`.

If files were selected but not committed, unselect without deleting:

```bat
git restore --staged .venv/
```

If a non-sensitive local-only folder was committed, stop tracking it but keep your local copy:

```bat
git rm -r --cached .venv/
git status
git diff --staged
```

Use the actual unwanted local-only folder, never a source folder. Review before committing on your branch:

```bat
git add .gitignore
git commit -m "Stop tracking local Python environment"
git push
```

Combine through a PR. This removes current tracking, not earlier history.

> [!WARNING]
> If private credentials were committed, ignore rules or later deletion are not a complete fix. Stop sharing affected content and use the relevant account or organisation process to revoke exposed credentials and handle the disclosure.

### 17.13 Switching branches or merging is blocked

#### Local changes would be overwritten

Do not discard them. Run `git status` and `git diff`. Save intended source changes in a commit on your work branch before switching.

#### Merge conflict

Use `git status` to identify state and conflicting files. Compare versions with the file's owner. Keep intended content, remove markers such as `<<<<<<<`, `=======` and `>>>>>>>`, save and run relevant tests.

For a local merge in progress, after resolving files:

```bat
git add PATH_TO_RESOLVED_FILE
git diff --staged
git commit
```

Replace the placeholder with the actual file. Follow Git's displayed instructions; do not run these blindly outside a merge.

To return to the state before an unresolved local merge, use `git merge --abort` only when `git status` confirms a merge is in progress.

If `git pull --ff-only` refuses because histories diverged, it has not started a merge. Preserve commits and inspect history before deciding how to combine changes. Do not use a destructive reset or force-push.

### 17.14 If you still cannot continue

1. Save your source files.
2. Keep the exact command and complete error message.
3. Note the filename, branch and selected browser.
4. Compare the affected step with the guide and another group member's working setup.
5. Keep private details out of anything you share.

Do not delete the project, reinstall everything or remove assertions as a first response. If the issue requires administrator permissions or managed-browser changes, use approved IT support. Otherwise, preserve progress and return to the specific blocked step.

## Closing reminder

A passing test means its particular checks succeeded in that run. It does not prove the whole website is error-free.

Keep examples small and understandable. Use failures to understand what happened. Share your own source, recordings, reports, generated results and selected PNGs. Keep environments, caches and private data out of Git.
